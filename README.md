### Sliding window genome scan (SlidingWindows.py, SlidingWindows_v4.py)

What does this script do?

This script calculates various diversity and differentiation statistics for individual or pooled sequence data for two or more populations. Two types of output are generated: (i) individual site statistics, (ii) sliding window averages of the same statistics (with adjustable overlaps). Different data manipulations with regards to data quality can be set by the user including, minimum and maximum depth and the minimum number of populations with required depth range for site inclusion. The script can also work with individual based data, as long as this is in the required format.
